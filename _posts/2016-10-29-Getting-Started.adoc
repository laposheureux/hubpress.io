Hello. This post feels like a construction gif of old. I'm setting up the basics of this site and playing around with its functionality to know what I can do next.

Ultimately, I plan to talk about past and current projects, technology that interests me, and other random things like games or a/v tech or travel or cats.

_Speaking of technology that interests me..._

This blog is powered by Hubpress, which is basically the easiest thing to setup I've ever seen. I don't want to npm/gem/whatever install or run a web server locally or build and deploy anything. The biggest friction point to writing a blog, in my opinion, is dealing with the non-writing and Hubpress is pretty frictionless. http://hubpress.io[Give it a try.]
