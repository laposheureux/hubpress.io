Over the past year, I distinctly recall a palpable frustration with Apple's lineup. Not much had changed tangibly in years and lots of people with lots of different needs were all devouring the rumors waiting for their specific needs to be solved. It was basically a perfect recipe for disappointment and oh has there been disappointment. Unfortunately the need to have top tier gaming performance, be able to run high-teens numbers of VMs, last all day on battery, have both old ports and only new ones, and more just can't all fit into one system. Not even a line of systems.

I want to talk to some of the ... _disinformation_ ... that had led to a number of complaints, but first there are certainly a few items that I think were mistakes (at least until USB-C has matured more fully) and helped cause even more unrest.

1. *No SD card slot*. In the past I believe the prevailing opinion was that anyone seriously moving photos from SD to a computer needed to get a high quality external SD card reader to guarantee speed/quality/data integrity. Apparently at some point the built in SD card reader in the Macbook Pros passed that test and it seems a vocal bunch of people could have been satisfied entirely with an SD card slot.

2. *No iGPU-only option for the 15" model*. Apple built expecations starting with the 2012 release of the Macbook Pro with Retina display that there would be a number of price tiers making the computers more accessible depending on your choice of compromises. Providing a 15" Macbook Pro without an AMD graphics option available could have helped extend that entry level 15" model price downward.

3. *No compatibility aids in the box*. One USB-C -> USB-A dongle wouldn't have been the end of the world. It'd bring out of the box compatibility for the iPhone, your current backup drive, and that one flash drive still attached to your keychain. Of course the quantity of complaints for "shipping a computer that comes with a dongle to be useful" would be just as bad as "I can't use anything without buying a dongle" but I digress... 

4. *Not refreshing the Mac Pro at the same time*. As We're going to find later on, Intel is a significant issue here. There aren't any hex-core Skylake-based Xeons out right now and 0 Kaby Lake Xeons. But Broadwell has tons of configurations and this machine should have been updated when _those_ became available. Yes, the GPU story would be incomplete as it would still have been stuck in the 28nm generation, but we wouldn't be 1000+ days since an update with no product to pitch towards people willing to spend _more money_ for _more computer_.


Ok, that list aside, the "it's not a pro laptop" crowd should really take a look back at the history of the Macbook Pro and the issues that were made large in the past...lest we forget the removal of Firewire and https://rubenerd.com/macbookpro-expresscard/[the ExpressCard slot, window="_blank"]. The prevailing argument of the time being that going from an ExpressCard slot to an SD card slot was a downgrade unlike other legacy eliminations of the time. Now we're back to a port that lets you connect a number of multipurpose things instead of a single use and that's bad too.

From here we enter the territory of "they literally could not do what you want" without either shipping nothing or shipping a piece of functionality that compromises the rest of the product too strongly in another area.

In order to prove that this future is the right future, Apple and third parties need to knock the functionality of the Touch Bar out of the park. I think we will find in the coming years that an all USB-C
