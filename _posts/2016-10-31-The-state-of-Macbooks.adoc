Over the past year, I distinctly recall a palpable frustration with Apple's lineup. Not much had changed tangibly in years and lots of people with lots of different needs were all devouring the rumors waiting for their specific needs to be solved. It was basically a perfect recipe for disappointment and oh has there been disappointment. Unfortunately the need to have top tier gaming performance, be able to run high-teens numbers of VMs, last all day on battery, have both old ports and only new ones, and more just can't all fit into one system. Not even a line of systems.

I want to talk to some of the ... _disinformation_ ... that had led to a number of complaints, but first there are certainly a few items that I think were mistakes and helped cause even more unrest.

1. *No SD card slot*. In the past I believe the opinion was that anyone seriously moving photos from SD to a computer needed to get one of a few external readers that were super fast and reliable and guaranteed not to wreck the SD card they were reading from. Apparently at some point the built in SD card reader in the Macbook Pros passed that test (the last time I tried, it was more finicky than I was willing to work with).

Ok, that list aside, the "it's not a pro laptop" crowd should really take a look back at the history of the Macbook Pro and the issues that were made large in the past...lest we forget the removal of Firewire and https://rubenerd.com/macbookpro-expresscard/[the ExpressCard slot, window="_blank"].
